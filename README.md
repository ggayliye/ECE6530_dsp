## Group Project : Sampling and Aliasing
Date: 17- November - 2024
Submission Date: By 6-December-2024, 11:59pm (The time of when the submission is due/will be ready to be evaluated)

### Overview of the Project

- The goal of this final project is to practice the concepts we learned in the class 
in the context of solving a specific problem in digital signal processing,implementing 
the solution and demonstrating that the solution on datasets.
- In the class, we learned the conversion of signals between the analog and digital 
domains and the basic ideas underlying sampling and signal reconstruction.
- When sampling to convert a continuous-time (or analog) signal to a digital 
form for computer processing and storage, the primary issue is aliasing and 
the sampling strategy necessary to avoid aliasing of frequency components.
- The main objective of this project is an understanding of the Sampling Theorem 
which states that the sampling rate must be greater than twice the highest frequency 
contained in the analog signal. 
- Frequency content is taken to mean the spectral content of a signal when represented as a sum of sinusoids.
- In this project, the signal reconstruction of a D-to-A converter is presentated from a practical point 
of view as a generalization of interpolation. <br>

*This Project Will Include The Following Two Lab Excersizes:* <br>
- ExP8: Digital Images: A/D and D/A : Sampling, Aliasing and Reconstruction
- ExS8: Spectrograms: Harmonic Lines & Chirp Aliasing 

### ExP8: Digital Images: A/D and D/A : Sampling, Aliasing and Reconstruction

Introducing digital images as a second practical signal type is the aim of this lab. 
We will demonstrate the implementation of the D-to-A reconstruction and A-to-D sampling 
procedures for digital photos. Specifically, we will demonstrate a widely used technique 
for image zooming (reconstruction) that produces subpar results; a subsequent lab will address 
this problem and improve.<br>
Please refer to the file "LabP8_DigitalImageLab.pdf" for details about this lab 
and the related files are located at the directory: \.materials\DigitalImageLab and \.materials\lab06.

### ExS8: Spectrograms: Harmonic Lines & Chirp Aliasing

This lab's goal is to learn more about the spectral content of 
signals that are evaluated using a spectrogram. In this lab, 
a number of particular steps will be taken into consideration:<br>

1. Synthesizing a linear-FM chirp with a Matlab M-file, and displaying its spectrogram. 
Choosing the chirp parameters so that aliasing will happen.<br>
2. Synthesizing a periodic triangle wave with a Matlab M-file, 
and displaying its spectrogram. Relating the harmonic line spectrum to the 
fundamental period of the triangle wave.<br>
3. Comparing spectrograms using different scales for amplitude: decibels (dB) 
for amplitude versus linear amplitude.<br>
4. Examining details of the harmonic lines in the dB spectrogram of the triangle wave.<br>
5. Spectrogram: making a spectrogram of your voice signal, and relating the harmonic line 
spectrum to your previous measurement of pitch period.<br>

Please refer to the file "LS8_ SpecgramHarmonicLinesChirpAliasing.pdf" for more details about this lab.


<pre><ins>Future extensions</ins> : This project is about a 3-week-long project. As a group members, 
we'll be continuously working on this project posting updates. There will be no extentions of this project 
after the listed due date wheather the assigned goals are accomplished or not. </pre>

### Partnership

This project is worked as the requirement of the "ECE 5530 / ECE 6530 - Digital Signal Processing" 
class at the the University of Utah. The class requirements demand 
this project to be done as a group of a minimum of three, and the maximum of four students. 
The group members for this project are listed on top of this page in the header. 
The project work is expected to be completed collectively with the group members.

### Progress Notes

<ins> On Nov 17th, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Create the draft files and post them on the Github repo. <br>
 
 <ins> On Nov 18th, 2024 : </ins> <br>
 - Meet with the team members and the professor to discuss about the project and logistics.
 
### Time Expenditures

<pre>Predicted Hours: 20h		Actual Hours:	h		 </pre>

The actual hours recorded on top will reflect the time spent 
on the project. It will exclude the extra time spent reading, researching, 
and understanding the contexts or materials that are required 
to complete the tasks related to this project.
